I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.


The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 500 from a 
random normal variable and the absolute value of each element of that sample, 
and produces a histogram of the absolute value.

```{r learning_assessment_1}
library(tidyverse)

la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500),
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm_samp)) + geom_histogram()
```

The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median(la_df$abs_norm_samp), digits = 2)`.
